 Movies Earnings in the US
This project is a React Native application that allows users to search for popular movies and view their release year and total earnings in the US. The data is sourced from a public API and displayed in a user-friendly interface with a modern design.

📝 Features
Search for Movies: Users can search for movies by title using a dynamic search input.
- View Movie Details: Each movie displays:
   Title
   Release Year
   Gross Earnings in USD
- Responsive Design: A sleek, dark-themed user interface that works across various screen sizes.
- Dynamic Data: Movie data is fetched in real-time from a public API.



How It Works
Fetch Data: The app fetches a list of movies from the API endpoint:

- Dynamic Search: As the user types in the search input, the list dynamically updates to show matching results.
- Render Movie Details: Each movie card displays its title, release year, and gross earnings.

Future Enhancements

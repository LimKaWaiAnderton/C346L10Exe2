How It Works
Fetch Data: The app fetches a list of movies from the API endpoint:
https://mysafeinfo.com/api/data?list=moviesbyearnings&format=json&case=default
- Dynamic Search: As the user types in the search input, the list dynamically updates to show matching results.
- Render Movie Details: Each movie card displays its title, release year, and gross earnings.

Future Enhancements
- Global Search: Extend the search to include release year or gross earnings.
- Sorting: Allow users to sort movies by year, title, or earnings.
- UI Improvements: Add animations and transitions for a smoother experience.
